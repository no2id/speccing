# Requirements
## for no2id.net v.3

For the next release of the no2id site, we'll need to support:

 - content rich pages
   - embeded non-autoplaying video
   - images in-line/wrapped around text
 
 - updatable content: via a CMS, or perhaps Jekyll

 - clear navigation

 - support for donations

 - mechanism to sign-up for campaign news (is there still stuff sent
 in the post to new conscripts?)

 - mechanism to discover local group, and take part in that
 
 - presentation of materials

 - possible resurrection of forum? -- or allow disqus style comments etc on
 newsblog, and have stuff there??

 - incorporated content from:
    - newsblog
    - press release archive?
    - newsletter archive?
    - twitter
    - facebook
    - instagram?
    - social media?

## Styling
The look of the website is ancient, and well overdue a facelift:
navigation should be simplified, probably top + bottom menus (and
maybe a context menu)

The site must be responsive (aka mobile friendly).

## Users
 - citizens
 - students
 - journos
 - representatives
 - assn. members
 - former members
 - researchers
 - editors/content creators

(revist this with insights from stats)

## User stories (lazily written)

 - As an editor, I want to be able to easily create content that's
 feature rich, and share this via social media easily

 - As a citizen, i want to know how to get updates on the campaign

 - As a student, i want to find materials I can cite

 - As a citizen, i want to find out how i can support the campaign

 - As a citizen, i want to take localized action
